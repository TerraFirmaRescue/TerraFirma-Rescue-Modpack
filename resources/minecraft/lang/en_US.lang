Hold 8 pieces of wood and right-click on the hay until the cube is full, then light it with the fire tool. %n%n4. Once the flame is burned, you can collect your ceramics by hand, or simply break the cube to collect everything. The important thing is that a flame burning in a clay kiln ignites a nearby flammable cube. For this reason, it is recommended not to burn in houses made of wood, hay or other flammable materials. However, the kiln will not be extinguished by the rain. 
tfr.quest3.name=§ §b§l"Novosibirsk" grows potatoes 
tfr.quest3.desc=In 1859, Pan Galactic GregTech Technology Co., Ltd. initiated the interstellar settlement program. You are a technical engineer on a spaceship that has been dormant for 200 years and has arrived in the Terrafirma planetary system. Unfortunately, the starship failed to slow down as it approached its target planet Terrafirma B, also known as The Duck Egg. Before the ship breaks up, you put on an anti-freeze suit and board an escape capsule, crash-landing in the middle of a wilderness on Yap's largest moon, The Mountain Star, which you call Novosibirsk. All this material has vanished into the destruction of the mothership, and what you have left is your intelligence, Nerve Implant search engine Nerve Explorer Injected(NEI), and this colonial technical instruction you are reading. This is not a wild continent. First you have to survive. The first condition is to find something to eat, and I'll give you some potatoes for you to plant. %n%n Important: click the item needed by the task to view the item synthesis! %n%n Important: Crown shaped quests are the main quests that unlock the next phase, rounded quests are the side quests! %n%n Important: The task line at the beginning of Tier is the "main tech line", which is what you must complete to pass this integrated package. However, other task lines also contain a lot of integrations! %n%n (please check the description of each task carefully, they cost me a lot of effort) 
tfr.quest4.name=Cut down a tree 
tfr.quest4.desc=As you have tried, your strength has weakened, and the trees of this world can no longer be dug with bare hands. You need to make a stone axe head to cut down the tree. Fortunately, all you have to do is cut down the root at the bottom and the whole tree will take root. 
tfr.quest5.name=§ § §lThe lost art 
tfr.quest5.desc=With the stone anvil, you can begin to forge metal. But the lower grade anvil can work very little metal, so weld the copper ingots with the stone anvil and make the copper anvil. %n%n has many different anvil, divided into different grades. Each grade is capable of more complex metalworking than previous grades. The anvil can weld high grade ingots together to form double ingots. All other forging must be done on an anvil of equal or higher quality. %n %n Example: stone anvil can only weld copper ingots. Copper anvil can weld copper ingot and copper alloy ingot. %n%n can recover the metal anvil in the crucible.%n%n§6§n the next task you only need to make any bronze anvil to unlock the next task 
tfr.quest6.name=Advanced workbench 
tfr.quest6.desc=The Advanced workbench is a non-essential but useful device. He can pipe in the liquid resources, and he can drum in the tanks at the top of the GUI. You can also put a storage tank next to it, which will automatically extract items when you synthesize. On the side is a drawer, which can also hold a lot of things, and a special slot for tools. Vigorously promote! 
tfr.quest7.name=Want to cut down a tree? 
tfr.quest7.desc=With stones, you can enter the Paleolithic age. To cut down a tree, you need a stone axe, not a hand. Making a stone tool is the process of using two stones to create a stone tool head. When you hold two or more stones, right-clicking will launch a GUI to knock a stone into the tool head. The tool head can then be attached to a stick to create a stone tool. Armor, chisel, mace, pick, mining pick, saw, sickle, and sword are not made of stone. 
tfr.quest8.name=An anvil 
tfr.quest8.desc=Stone anvil is obtained by right clicking on an intrusive or igneous block with a hammer. It is lower in height than other stones. Right-click the anvil to open the GUI and place the hammer inside so that the anvil does not become a regular stone. Intrusive rocks: diorite, gabbro, granite %n Igneous rocks: andesite, basalt, dacite, rhyolite 
tfr.quest9.name=Scales: Cut food 
tfr.quest9.desc=Weights are needed to cut food accurately 
tfr.quest10.name=Smelting ore 
tfr.quest10.desc=Ceramic vases (also known as pottery jars) can be used to refine primary copper, tetrahedrite or malachite to produce pure copper. To do this, the ore is placed in a pot (different minerals can be put in the same pot) and then heated in a clay kiln. %n %n After firing, retrieve the jar from the kiln and right-click it to open its GUI. Now you'll see that instead of the usual four slots, the jar has only one slot and contains text describing the amount of metal it contains. After firing, the metal will remain liquid for about 10 minutes. If the metal inside solidifies, you have to put it back into a kiln to melt it. %n Note: cans with molten metal inside will have a white "liquid" prompt. %n%n take the vase right, put the pick mold or other mold in, you can get the pick metal!%n%n  equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal   equal %n%n ceramic vase also can be used to make bronze and dark bronze and bismuth bronze. %n%n Before firing: Place the necessary ore in a ceramic pot to make the desired copper alloy in the proper proportion. For example, if you want to make ordinary bronze, you can put copper ore (any native copper, malachite or tetrahedrite) and tin concentrate in ceramic vases. For each alloy, there is a range of proportions to produce the desired alloy, so as long as you are within the range, you don't have to reach the exact percentage. 
tfr.quest11.name=§b§lmetal smelting 
tfr.quest11.desc=Want to temporarily bid farewell to the anvil board, processing part of the parts? This GregTech Tech cauldron is your best helper. Note: this crucible cannot process the original ore you dug! You must treat the raw ore as crushed ore/washed ore/ore powder, or turn it into a metallic substance before you can melt it. For now, the crucible's biggest use will be in its alloys. The crucible made it easier to make complex alloys of black, blue and red steel. Usage: first, put the combustion chamber under the crucible, put the mold on a y plane of the dry pot, placed next to the crucible. The items to be smelted are dropped into a dry pot and then right-clicked into the combustion chamber into any fuel such as coal, wood, etc. Next, right-click the combustion chamber with GT and there is a chance of igniting a fire. Next, you can wait for the metal to melt in a dry pan, or for the alloy to change color. Right - click the mold with your hand/pliers to export the metal. After waiting for the metal to solidify, right click again to remove the metal. You'll get burned if you don't use pliers. There is a melting temperature in the description of %n%n crucible, once the continued heating exceeds this temperature, the crucible will melt (the surrounding squares will not be damaged, but your crucible will disappear), I suggest you do this task, before using, first look at the temperature task next to it. %n%n molds can be made with chisels in various shapes, such as plates, ingots, rods, and gears. You can see the tutorial. Exporting metal is the shape you make. For example, the board is completely empty. This will save you a lot of time. 
tfr.quest12.name=§ § §lboil water! 
tfr.quest12.desc=Your first steam production facility on this trip. It's time to boost productivity! Although you can enter the age of steam after completing the black anvil, I would suggest that you complete the red anvil or blue anvil task line, so that you can obtain the GT crucible, a strong stimulation tool, otherwise you would be extremely short of materials in the age of steam. Note: you will notice that the task is now divided into two symmetrical sides, bronze and steel. You can choose whichever side you want, and you can push your technology forward by completing the crown shape task.%n 
tfr.quest13.name=§ §lb cast iron anvil 
tfr.quest13.desc=You realize that if you want to further develop your metal smelting process, the use of bronze grade anvil seems a little weak. Looking at your newly obtained ingot of wrought iron, you think it is strong enough to weld ingots or process wrought iron. 
tfr.quest14.name=The original blast furnace 
tfr.quest14.desc=A minimum blast furnace structure is as follows :%n%nC equal  crucible B equal  furnace F equal  firebrick W equal  bellows A equal  air %n%n % first layer :%nAAA%nAAA%nABW%nAAA%n %n %n% third layer :%nAFA%nFAF%nAFA%nFAF%nn %n§lBellows black holes must be aimed at %n%n %n%n§lforgings attached to the sides of all firebricks %n§ O § § O § N how to make steel :%n%n1.Place an air nozzle in the blast furnace. To make iron ore from a blast furnace, the ore must be thrown onto the top of the blast furnace with the same amount of flux and the same or more amounts of charcoal. Each layer of the blast furnace can process four pieces of ore, with a firearm or flint to set the blast furnace block on fire. %n Note: to maintain high temperatures, it is recommended to maintain a charcoal to ore ratio of 1:1 or higher after initial charcoal throwing. If there is more ore than charcoal, the temperature will start to drop. Blast furnace GUI can be opened by right-clicking the blast furnace block. Thermometer: this shows the temperature of the blast furnace. By adding more charcoal or by placing bellows on both sides of the blast furnace and pumping air, the temperature can be raised. Ore: How much unmelted ore is in the blast furnace. Charcoal: How much charcoal is in the blast furnace. Ordinary coal cannot be used in blast furnace, can use charcoal only! Note: make sure this bar is always equal to or fuller than the ore bar! The ratio of charcoal to ore is at least 1:1, and with bellows used, the temperature is kept high enough for the ore to begin to melt. The ore counter will eventually run out and fill the output counter with the resulting metal. Iron ore is smelted in a blast furnace, where bellows are used to continue heating until the iron ore melts and flows into cauldrons underneath to receive liquid pig iron. You need to use a ceramic mold to remove the melted pig iron. Pig iron and steel are not far off. Forge cast iron anchorage into high carbon steel ingot in wrought iron or above anvil and reforge into ingot.%n%n 
tfr.quest15.name=How can I do without water 
tfr.quest15.desc=You notice that you now have the moisture content attribute. Well, shouldn't there be? You can right-click a fresh water cube and drink from it (fresh water lakes have reeds) or fill this water bottle with water. %n%n Every time you use a ceramic work, it may break. The odds are different for each item. When things break, they make a crisp sound.%n 
tfr.quest16.name=Where does the water come from? 
tfr.quest16.desc=A steam boiler can explode when it's dry, so you add water to it... There are two ways to add water, manual and automatic. You need an original bucket to add water by hand. It's easy to make. But it is very troublesome, you need a device to automatically add water to the boiler. %n%n First of all you can use a water impounder, one might not be enough, do a few more. %n%n Ordinary water will cause boiler calcification, it is recommended to use a dryer to produce distilled water. 
tfr.quest17.name=§ § §lA steam engine 
tfr.quest17.desc=The steam engine is an important machine for you today, you point its outlet at the crucible and you start it and it pumps air into the crucible. 
tfr.quest18.name=Mass production of steel! 
tfr.quest18.desc=Steel is an important raw material. It can be used in combustors, boilers, engines, steam turbines, machinery, and some of the more advanced alloys. %n A steam engine can pump air into a crucible and slowly convert iron into steel by adding iron to the crucible at a temperature (see NEI for details). Don't fill the cauldron, or the air won't pump in 
tfr.quest19.name=Mixing bowl 
tfr.quest19.desc=Make a mixture of glue and clay, right click and stir. %n%n Be careful not to make the flame recipe when making clay bricks, carve them vertically first, otherwise it will cause flash back.%n 
tfr.quest20.name=Good healthy water 
tfr.quest20.desc=Boiler can be delicate, ordinary water will let the boiler calcification, calcification will let the efficiency of the boiler reduced. Calcification can be removed with a chisel, but must be removed when there is no pressure on the boiler or it will explode. %n is very troublesome, isn't it? %n so you need distilled water. Distilled water doesn't calcify the boiler. Distilled water can be obtained by treating fresh water, sea water, sewage and other water-containing liquids and solids with a dryer, and even tungsten trioxide, but the most rapid and efficient treatment is fresh water. The water from the cluster can be pumped directly into the dryer instead of the original water. 
tfr.quest21.name=The rapid melting pot 
tfr.quest21.desc=The recipe is the same as the forge furnace, and each coal can process at least 90 items, and it is extremely fast, at least ten times faster than the original forge furnace, GregTech Weli! %n%n requires the combustion chamber to provide heat directly below

tfr.quest23.desc=The dryer has not only steel this one version, Invar, titanium, tungsten carbide can do the dryer. Of course, more advanced dryers require more HU. The dryers of Invar are not much more expensive than steel and are much faster. %n* I recommend a chrome combustion chamber with a steel dryer, chromium is not too expensive to find chromite. If you want to use a titanium chamber, I won't stop you. 
tfr.quest24.name=§ §bl sulfuric acid 
tfr.quest24.desc=Sulfuric acid is very important, he can make hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, processing minerals and so on. To make it you need to make at least two bronze agitators. The first requires a vent for air, sulfur dioxide that you get in the calciner, and a platinum powder or vanadium pentoxide (not consumed) to make sulfur trioxide %n%n A second mixer for sulfur trioxide and water to make sulfuric acid. The more the better! §4%n%n§r To submit a task you need to make a water tank, which is attached to the outlet of the machine to get the liquid.

tfr.quest27.name=§ §bl turbines 
tfr.quest27.desc=Consumption SU(steam) produces RU%n to output distilled water from the side. If no fluid vessel or pipe is available, distilled water will be destroyed automatically. %n If facing up, the creature will rotate by itself %n%n notice, only the crown shape task is the main task, in other words the other machines are chosen. 
tfr.quest28.name=crusher 
tfr.quest28.desc=The first machine for mineral processing. Will do. Small %nTFC ores can be obtained through RC crucible, but they cannot be smelted directly in GT crucible. So you need to deal with them further. The %n crusher automatically breaks small ore into crushed ore or raw ore into crushed ore, producing twice as much ore as you break with a hammer. Either way, it can provide you with an almost eightfold increase in production. But it's made of diamonds. Come on, look for the Kimberlite. Kimberlite digs have a chance of dropping diamonds of different qualities, which can be processed by a crusher into a pulverized diamond mine. A crushed diamond mine can be washed and filtered through a sieve to produce diamonds of different qualities. You'll need at least two diamonds to make it. If you can't find the Kimberlite, check out the other quest rewards or the Multipurpose store.

Then use a firearm or a group of TFCs to make a forge furnace block. %n%n Where the coal icon is displayed in the forge furnace, coal or charcoal can be placed on top of the heated metal. You heat the metal by putting it in a forge. As the temperature rises, the color of the metal changes (you can't tell, but it's shown below the item), and the item becomes "machismo," then "weldable," then "dangerous." Be careful when the metal goes into the "dangerous" state, as further heating may cause your metal to melt. %n%n When the metal is melted, if there is an ingot mould in the five columns on the right, the molten metal will enter the mould; if there is no mould, the metal will disappear directly. 
tfr.quest38.name=Basic electronic circuit (welding completed) 
tfr.quest38.desc=Similar to making galvanized steel, an electronic circuit can be obtained by introducing molten solder into a stainless steel dip basin and then dipping a circuit board. It is important to note that there are three types of solder: lead, tin, and brazing alloys (tin and antimony 9:1). If lead or tin is used as solder, the resulting electronic circuit will be 2 and 1 levels lower than the circuit board level, and only brazing alloy can ensure that the electronic circuit level does not drop.

tfr.quest101.name=The temperature 
tfr.quest101.desc=Different dry melting POTS have different melting temperatures, as you can see at Tootip. This determines the maximum melting point of the metal they can smelt. Ceramic crucible, for example, could not be used to make iridium, but chrome crucible could. It's important to make a dry pot with a higher melting point, which allows you to make stronger metals. In general, dry POTS are made of ceramic - chrome - iridium. For you now, the highest level you can get is iridium. To keep the cauldron from melting over the temperature, you need to make a thermometer to see the cauldron's temperature in real time. %n%n First prepare a glass bottle, then you need three cinnabar powder, drop it into the crucible, fill it with 144L liquid mercury. Drop two planks into the combustion chamber and ignite (you can't drop too much fuel, the mercury evaporates easily), just enough to turn cinar into mercury, which is liquid at room temperature, so you don't have to worry about solidifying. You can obtain the mercury bottle by right-clicking the glass bottle directly against the liquid inside the crucible. Now that we've got the thermometer we can monitor the temperature of the cauldron all the time and we're not afraid of the fryer anymore.

tfr.quest106.name=Burning!!!! ~ ~ 
tfr.quest106.desc=The combustion chamber. The most direct way you can get heat, or HU, is also the source of heat for a steam boiler, but not just. Many of GregTech Tech's machines use heat. Until you make an electric heater, you'll need them. The heat output from the top (HU)%n%n combustion chamber is divided into solid, liquid and gas. The advantages and disadvantages of the three combustors are analyzed here. §4§lsolid combustor, using solid fuel, all fuel that can be used in a furnace (except magma) can be stuffed into a solid combustor and used as fuel. When you want to stop heating, you need to plug the front of the combustion chamber and wait for the current burning fuel to burn out. When using a solid combustion chamber for mineral smelting, be sure to wait for the fire to shut off before pouring. Because the less the contents of the crucible, the faster it heats up, if the crucible is left empty or near empty without being extinguished, the temperature will rise so rapidly that it will explode (in effect, melt). Suitable for equipment that requires long-term heating and high fault tolerance, but because of the need to manually add fuel and the need to periodically clean the ash after combustion, solid combustion Chambers are not recommended after the distillation column has been built. §2§lliquid combustor, the safest and most stable combustor, using combustible liquids: the best you can get right now is creosote (wines, creosote, and petroleum distillates are good for combustion, other oils have too low calorimetric values). Since the flammable liquid burns 1L/1ticks, when you want to stop heating, you just plug the front and stop heating immediately. When a mineral is smelted in a liquid combustion chamber, the heating can be stopped at a higher standard temperature to prevent solidification during the pouring process. %n%n§9§lgas combustor, long - acting combustor. The calorific value of propane butane is slightly higher than the calorific value of gasoline and other petroleum distilling oil, and each combustion USES 5~7L to burn 30~42ticks, so the shutdown will be delayed by about one second. Suitable for distillation column, steam boiler and other long-term heating sources. Note: depending on the oil found, a liquid or gas combustor may be used. The heavier the oil, the less the gas, and the more the oil and solid products, and vice versa.

On the contrary, the fruit trees grow slowly, with branches and leaves coming out in stages. This means that the saplings will eventually grow back after the branches have been cut off for harvest. But it also means that saplings take a long time to grow into trees as big as those in the wild. The trunk will reach its maximum height after 30 days, with a branch every 20 days and a leaf every two days. At harvest time, the tree will have a fruit on each leaf. To harvest the fruit, right-click on the leaves or left-click on the leaves and the fruit will fall.

Growing crops in the soil reduces soil nutrients and must be fallow, fertilized, or planted periodically with crops that require different nutrient types in order to replenish nutrients. Note: Some crops, such as soybeans and green beans, require additional nutrients as they grow. %n%n Unlike the original, farmland cannot be turned back into soil. The destruction of cropland also does not produce any soil to prevent the reuse of nutrients. 
tfr.quest274.name=Animal husbandry: 1 
tfr.quest274.desc=Chickens, cows, horses, pigs and sheep are all livestock. The natural generation of the world's animals is based on the climate of the region. %n%n livestock will follow any kind of refined grain and ear of corn, similar to the original animals will follow wheat, carrots and seeds. The rope is also the same as in the original drawing of livestock %n%n Bears, deer and pheasants are wild animals and cannot breed. Wild animals will be refreshed all over the world, except named animals, or at least tethered once, which won't disappear. All animals have a degree of intimacy that increases the need to interact in some way, such as milking, shearing, riding, raising and naming animals. The exact value of these interactions varies from species to species, and some require more interaction. Familiarity can be improved by performing specific actions every 24 game hours. To raise an animal, the player must sneak around to provide food so that the animal does not get spooked. If intimacy does not reach 30% and the animal does not interact with the human within 24 hours, then intimacy will decline. Adult animals are limited in their ability to be domesticated, only small animals can be fully domesticated, and intimacy increases faster. Young animals retain 50 per cent of their mother's closeness at birth, unless she is close to the maximum, in which case they will retain 90 per cent. %n%n Stealthily looking at an animal displays a closeness indicator. As the intimacy increases, the indicator will fill with red, and when it reaches 100%, it will turn gold. A white border means that the animal has reached at least 30% and intimacy is no longer diminished. %n%n Sex: %n%n animals (excluding squid) have different sex (male or female), which is determined randomly at the time of animal generation. With the exception of bears, horses and wolves, all animals have visual cues to easily determine sex, such as horns, teeth, breasts and different feather colors. For creatures with no visual cues, players can right click on the animal, and the chat window will indicate gender. 
tfr.quest275.name=Animal husbandry: Reproduction 
tfr.quest275.desc=All reproducible animals except chickens are bred by bringing together animals of different genders and feeding them until heart-shaped particles begin to appear. The animals consumed 5 ounces of grain each time they were fed, and if both animals had the heart, they would approach within seconds of the particles disappearing. A successful breeding can be confirmed by right-clicking on the female animal, which will produce a chat message, "pregnant". %n % chicken %n%n chickens are bred by using nesting boxes. The hen will lay an egg in the nest box every day. If there is a rooster in the box, the egg will be fertilized. A fertilized egg has a hint of fertilization on it. After three quarters of a month in the nest, the fertilized eggs hatch into chicks. Note: This calculation is based on months, not days. So a world with a long month will have a longer incubation period because there are more days in a month. %n%n pregnancy and baby %n%n all reproducible animals except chickens, the female will become pregnant directly after breeding. Once a female becomes pregnant, she must pass through pregnancy before giving birth. Note: This calculation is based on months, not days. Therefore, longer months will lead to longer pregnancies. %n%n When the time of conception is complete, the female gives birth. The length of pregnancy, the length of adulthood, and the number of offspring born depend on the type of animal.%n 
tfr.quest276.name=charcoal 
tfr.quest276.desc=(If you don't have a home now, come back to this task later) %n%n How do you make charcoal? You need a charcoal pit. %n%n Stealth with a hand log and right click to get a pile of logs. Open with an empty hand to put up to 16 logs. The smallest version of a charcoal pit is a pile of wood (unlimited maximum) with four logs to ensure that at least one piece of charcoal is produced. Make a hole in the top of the pile, throw in a torch and light it. Then seal it with dirt. %n%n Players will have about 10 seconds after throwing their torches to the ground. Once it catches fire, the charcoal pit must be covered with any non-flammable solid blocks. Any exposed pile of logs will burn and eventually drop the logs, causing the ignition to fail. If the ignition is successful, smoke particles will be released from the covered pit. After 18 hours of play time, the smoke particles will dissipate and the logs will be turned into charcoal blocks that can be harvested one at a time with a shovel. Note: Only a full log pile can have another log pile on it, so plan the height accordingly. %n%n If there is a gravitation block in the pit, such as earth or boulder, these blocks will collapse because air blocks are created when logs turn into charcoal. Most of the larger charcoal pits are made of stone and brick to provide a more durable structure. 
tfr.quest277.name=Scientific glass technology 
tfr.quest277.desc=To make glass, you can either dig up borax or make crude caustic soda. See NEI for specific fabrication methods %n%n Original sand can be obtained by disordered composition.

There is a constant blast of air to make steel. 
tfr.quest279.name=Smelting iron ore 
tfr.quest279.desc=Open the opening of the forge and place eight pieces of charcoal at the bottom of the chimney. %n%n climb to the top of the forge and drop 24 iron ore (depending on its size) into the chimney. %n%n throw equal or more charcoal over the lump of charcoal. Both the ore and the charcoal should disappear into the lump of charcoal. %n%n Note: if the player throws more ore than the forge can hold, the extra ore floats on the charcoal instead of melting. %n%n Activate the forge by right clicking on the forge block with the starter or flint. The tops of forge iron stoves and chimneys should begin to glow. %n%n When it's done, the glow disappears, and the process takes about 15 game hours. Open the forge iron furnace to obtain the iron billet. %n%n use a pick to break the iron. This item will automatically move to the nearest forge box for easy pickup. %n%n%n billet is a porous mixture of iron and slag produced by smelting iron ore in a forge iron furnace. The product of a forge iron furnace is a cast iron billet. The iron content of a cast iron billet will have a percentage value, of which 1 percent is equal to one metal unit (100 units of ore will produce 100 percent of the billet, corresponding to a wrought iron ingot). Note: If not enough ore is added to the forge, its iron percentage will be less than 100%, then it cannot be refined and must be put back into the forge to add more ore. Next, you need to refine, shard, and beat the cast iron billets with an anvil of bronze grade or higher.   you will get your first wrought iron. Please cool the forging iron ingot in the bucket in order to submit the task
