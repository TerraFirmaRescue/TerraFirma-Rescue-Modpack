Notes:
Both the 3.3.2.0 and 3.3.3.0 integration packages have serious bugs. if you have updated to the 3.3.3.0 or 3.3.2.0 client.
Look for an archive backup of version 3.3.1.3 (normally the upgrade integration package will automatically save one in the saves folder).
And take out the level.dat and session.lock from the original archive and replace them with the files you have now.
Then, you can update only the version 3.3.4.0 that we will release. Otherwise, you'll have ID misalignment issues!
